The purpose of this document is to explain how to create our design of a novel visual game with Ren’py. The main part of a design for a novel game are characters, dialog trees, story, and images. Also, Ren’Py supports Python language for the coding part. Our scope of our project is to build an interactive dating simulator. That has users complete mini-games and conversation choices to determine their standing and outcome. The objective is to choose a path that has different characters programmed to interact with the user. In which the user would need to choose a different outcome to have a standing in a love/hate gauge. That determines the ending of the program. 

The functionality of our application would be purely entertainment based interactive storytelling for the user experienced with sound and basic art design.Only background information of basic flash player games would suffice.
